So, I've recently completed the basic maths course on Patika. 

Honestly, the course was quite shallow for any ordinary person who could need a hand learning things. Even so, it was just what i needed.
I've already been meaning to get back into the mathematical side of programming. This course gave me just that. Especially with the matrix
calculations that were given through a youtube channel from the outside.

Let's talk about the points that were mentioned. In the videos, the author aided us to a new understanding of matrices; to seeing them as
vector-space transformations. This had already taken my interest deep into the course. It might look low-effort to the blind eye, yet the
moment you think about it, these videos were hand-picked to correctly suit what a programmer will need in a basic level to perform in their
work.

Finishing the course actually didn't feel like an accomplishment. I know I need more, but there is not enough time on my hands right now.
I will be continuing my journey with maths as free time presents itself to me. For now though, off we go to the game dev journey yet again.
